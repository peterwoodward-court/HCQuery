# HCQuery
This is the working code and model for implementation of our predictive model for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy from OCT B-scans

What it does: A concise summary of the model (e.g., binary classifier for X condition using Y imaging modality).
	
 How to use it: Clear steps for setting up the environment and running inference (e.g., using the notebook or script).
 
 Input and Output: Expected image format, preprocessing (if any), and output interpretation (e.g., probability thresholding, class labels).
 
 Dependencies: Link to requirements.txt or environment.yml.
 
 Caveats: Clarify the modelâ€™s scope (e.g., trained on specific population, device, setting).
 
 Citation: How to cite your clinical paper.
